# Welcome table attributes in your product pages
::: meta-data type="New" features="Governance" available="Late-October" in="EE" link-to-doc="../articles/manage-multidimensional-data-in-a-table.html"

We don't create new attributes every year, table attribute is quite special. It'll make your product page a lot more easy to read as you use a PIM native functionality instead of using smart but not scalable workarounds. We've developed 4 templates based on your use-cases such as nutritional facts or packaging dimensions. But feel free to design your own using up to four different column types and importing up to 8000 options to define rows. Once your products are enriched, benefit from the Akeneo powerful filtering tools to find exactly what you need within a table.

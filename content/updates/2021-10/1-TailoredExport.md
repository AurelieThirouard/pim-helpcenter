# Replace value operation available in Tailored Export
::: meta-data type="New" features="Productivity" available="mid-October" in="EE" link-to-doc="../articles/tailored-export.html#discover-operations"

Prepare your export profiles once and adapt to your distributors' requirements. You call this sweater 'Orange', they say it's 'Pumpkin Orange'. From your tailored export, easily match attributes options and reference entities records to your distributors' values. The beauty is that, once it's done, you can duplicate it and use it as much as you need, you no longer need to do it manually afterwards. With all that time saved, treat yourself with a pumpkin latte!

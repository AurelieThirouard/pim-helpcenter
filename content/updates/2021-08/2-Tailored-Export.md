# Tailored export - **customize your product information exports**

type="New" features="Productivity" available="mid-August" in="EE,GE" link-to-doc="../articles/tailored-export.html"
:::

This feature consists in a new export profile, available only for our Enterprise Edition or Growth Edition users (*available soon*). It helps you to export your product information in flat files, with your own structure.
For instance, let's assume your retailers or distributors need the same product information from you, but they want different structures:
* Retailer A wants an export with columns named: "Identifier", "Product Name", "Description", and "Weight (Ounces)".
* Retailer B wants an export with columns named: "Name in French", "Name in English", "Description 1", "ID", and "Weight (Kilograms)".

Previously, you had to export your product information thanks to a regular product export profile, and manually modify your spreadsheet to reorder the columns, change their name, convert the measurements, for as many retailers and distributors that needed it.
Now, prepare the work from Akeneo PIM creating a Tailored Export profile per your retailer's or distributor's requirements and use it as often as necessary. **You no longer need to manually edit your flat files as soon as you need to share product information.**

The attribute options screen for single and multiple-select attributes has been completely redesigned to give you a better user experience. Navigate more easily between your option codes and their translations, and manage your attribute options more efficiently.

Also, the navigation of the attribute options page is now much easier to use. When working on long lists of options, you can now search using an option code or label and directly fill in your option labels. This should be quite handy when handling numerous options for your attributes.

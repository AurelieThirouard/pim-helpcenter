# Work More Productively with a Revamped Category Screen

In order to improve your user experience with category management, we have rebuilt it from scratch. Take a close look, you'll see how easy it is to create new categories now.

And there's more! When creating a new category, you can now define its label for the current locale together with the code. This is quite a time saver as you no longer need to click around to access the label field.

Plus, when navigating through the categories, when going back to your category trees, you will see a collapsed view showing in which context the category you were editing is. Create and manage your categories more efficiently than ever before!

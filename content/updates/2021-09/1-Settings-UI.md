# Welcome to your new System Menu
::: meta-data type="New" features="Productivity" available="mid-August" in="EE,GE"

This is your brand new System Menu. It is structured into two main categories: `System Navigation` and `Users Management Navigation` settings. This will be familiar, as it looks very much like its older sister, the `Settings` menu released a couple of months ago.

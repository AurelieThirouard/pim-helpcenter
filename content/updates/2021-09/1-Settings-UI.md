# Welcome to your new System menu
::: meta-data type="New" features="Productivity" available="mid-August" in="EE,GE"

This is your brand new System menu. It is structured into two main categories: `System Navigation` and `Users Management Navigation` settings. You won't be lost as it looks very much like its older sister, the `Settings` menu released a couple of month ago.

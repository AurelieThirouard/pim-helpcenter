# Import records

As explained in [this article](enrich-your-reference-entity-records.html#create-several-records), you can import a set of records using a xlsx or a csv file.
To do so:
- Go to the `Imports` tab of your PIM
- Create a new import profile and define its code, label, and choose the `Reference entity record import in CSV` or `Reference entity record import in XLSX` job


# Export records

It is also possible to export a set of records belonging to the same reference entity. To do so:
- Go to the `Exports` tab of your PIM
- Create a new export profile and define its code, label, and choose the `Reference entity record export in CSV` or `Reference entity record export in XLSX` job
- Don't forget to select a reference entity in the `Global settings` tab.

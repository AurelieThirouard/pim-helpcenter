# Improving data quality
Data quality is key in offering a compelling product experience to your customers.
In Akeneo PIM you can measure and follow your data quality thanks to the **quality score**.

## Improve data quality on variant products and product models

If you work with variant products, you will see slight differences between simple products, product models and variant products.

To help you craft compelling product experiences, the **quality score** aims at helping you improve the data quality of your end-customer facing product data. The product your customer is interested in is the product variant. Therefore, the **quality score** is calculated and displayed only at the variant level.

For **product models**:
![Image data quality product model panel](../img/data-quality-model-panel.png)

For **sub-product models**:
- Recommendations are given for attributes at the product model and sub-product model levels. By clicking on an attribute name, you can go and improve an attribute in the product model or sub-product model.

For **variant products**:
![Image data quality variant panel](../img/data-quality-variant-panel.png)

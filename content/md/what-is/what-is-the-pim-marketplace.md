# Connect your PIM from Akeneo Marketplace

At Akeneo, we know that you need to centralize all your product data, but you also need to retrieve and share it. This is why we introduced the `Connections` in Akeneo PIM 4.0.

Thanks to our community and partners, we have plenty of connectors ready to be connected to your PIM. 
From ERP to e-commerce, including Translation, DAM, Print, or Syndication connectors, ready to explore this whole new world?

But how can you find these connectors? How can you get in touch with their creators? How can you buy a connector? So many questions to answer! This is why we created [Akeneo Marketplace](https://marketplace.akeneo.com/).

## Where to find Akeneo Marketplace

Because we know it can be tedious to leave your work environment to find the connector you need, we bring them to you. We developed the PIM `Marketplace` as a way for you to smoothly identify the most relevant connector directly from your PIM interface.

From your PIM, you can see all the connectors available on our Marketplace and compatible with your Akeneo PIM version and edition. When you identify a connector that seems interesting, click on `More info` to access the connector documentation. 

This is where you'll be able to read all the connector documentation, consult all the available screenshots, reach the connector developer or even download the connector itself. 

To find the connectors you need, go to `Connect`, then click on `Marketplace`, and here you are! 

## What's a connector?
A connector is a bridge between Akeneo PIM and a third-party component or application. 
It enables data collection and sharing to one or several channels.

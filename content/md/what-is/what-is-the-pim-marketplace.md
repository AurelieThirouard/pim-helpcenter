# The first step to connect your PIM

At Akeneo, we know that you need to gather all your product data, but, you also need to retrieve product data or share them. This is why we introduced the `Connections` in Akeneo PIM 4.0.

Thanks to our community and partners, we have plenty of extensions ready to be activated on your PIM. 
From Import/Export to e-commerce, including Translation, DAM, Print or Syndication extensions, this is a whole new world that opens to you!

But how to find these extensions, how to get in touch with their creators, how to buy a connector? Lots of questions to answer! That's why, we created the `Akeneo marketplace` you can access right here: [https://marketplace.akeneo.com/](https://marketplace.akeneo.com/)

# What's the PIM Marketplace?

To ease the way find the right extension to connect your Akeneo PIM to its ecosystem we developed the PIM `Marketplace`.

Thanks to the PIM `Marketplace`, you are able to see all the connectors available on our Marketplace and compatible with your Akeneo PIM version and edition. When you find a connector that could be interesting, you just have to click on `More info` to reach the connector documentation. 

From that page, you'll be able to read all the connector documentation, consult all the available screenshots, reach the connector developer or even download it. 

To find the connectors you may need, go to your PIM `Connect` menu, click on `Marketplace`, and here you are! 

## What's a connector?
An Akeneo connector is a bridge between Akeneo PIM and a third-party component or application. 
It enables to collect data or spread it to one or multiple channel(s). 

To comply with the Serenity Edition (full-SaaS mode), Akeneo connectors should rely on our web API and be hosted outside the PIM interface. Akeneo API provides all necessary endpoints to connect the PIM structure and entities with any application.

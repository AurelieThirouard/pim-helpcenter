# How to connect Akeneo PIM with third parties

At Akeneo, we know that you need to centralize all your product data, but you also need to retrieve and share it. This is why we introduced the Connections in Akeneo PIM 4.0.

For 2 years, the Connections have been the best way to connect Akeneo PIM with a third party, and thanks to our community and partners, we have plenty of connectors ready to be connected to your PIM. 

But you may know, or you don't, and that's fine, that it requires technical skills to understand and install a connector. Moreover, the person in charge of setting up the connection must know the permission system perfectly if you are an EE customer.  

These are the reasons why we now introduce the `Apps`. 

## What is an App?
Apps are the new way to connect Akeneo PIM with third parties. But, it's also a way to interact with it. 

Apps can retrieve and push data from and into Akeneo PIM thanks to the REST API and events. And thanks to the simple activation process, **anyone can connect an App to Akeneo PIM** despite these technical interactions. 

Moreover, Apps will be able to interact with Akeneo PIM thanks to future features we'll add. We want Apps to display helpful information inside the PIM or add interaction buttons to the PIM user interface to give you more value. 

## Where to find all these Apps & connectors?
Because we know it can be tedious to leave your work environment to find the App or connector you need, we bring them to you. We developed the PIM `Marketplace` as a way for you to smoothly identify the most relevant App or connector directly from your PIM interface.

You can see all the apps and connectors available on our Marketplace and compatible with your Akeneo PIM version and edition. When you identify something that seems interesting, click on `More info` to access the related documentation. 

The web marketplace is where you'll be able to read all the documentation, consult all the available screenshots, reach the seller, etc.

To find the apps or connectors you need, go to `Connect`, then click on `Marketplace`, and here you are! 

# You found the perfect App and want to connect it to your PIM

::: info
Want to connect a connector? Please, go to our documentation: [How to connect my PIM? (legacy)](https://help.akeneo.com/pim/serenity/articles/how-to-connect-my-pim-legacy.html)
:::

There are two ways to activate an App: 
- either your App is compatible with the **fast activation**, and you see a Connect button on the Marketplace page, 
- or your App uses the **activation by link**, and you received this link from the App seller.

<!-- //TODO Add a screenshot with the two different buttons. -->

## Your App is compatible with the fast activation
If you see the `Connect` button in the App card on the Marketplace page, you just have to click on it, and the App will open in a new tab. 
At this point, the App is in charge. If you need more help, please go to the App documentation using the `More info` button. 

::: tips
The `Connect` may be disabled. If that's the case, please get in touch with an Administrator. That means you don't have the `Manage Apps` permission on your PIM. 
:::

## Your App uses the activation by link
If the App uses the activation by link, the App card on the Marketplace page displays the `Activate by link` button. That means you'll have one simple additional step to connect your App with your PIM. 

To do so, you have to:
- Click on the `Activate by link` button, 
- Fill in the `Activation link` field and click on `Connect`.

::: info
If you don't have any activation link yet, please click on `More info` and contact the App developer to get all the information.
